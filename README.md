# Designing and Optimizing an E-Commerce Database

## Overview

This repository presents a **highly optimized E-Commerce Database** built with industry-standard practices in **database engineering** and **system architecture**. The design emphasizes normalization, indexing, and transaction reliability, ensuring both scalability and efficiency for online retail systems.

The project includes a **comprehensive schema design**, SQL scripts for implementation, an **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram**, and generated sample datasets for validation and testing.

## Key Features

- **Third Normal Form (3NF) Normalization** – Eliminates redundancy and maintains data integrity.
- **Advanced Indexing** – Increases query performance on frequently accessed attributes.
- **Foreign Key Enforcement** – Maintains relationships between entities and prevents orphan records.
- **Partitioning** – Speeds up queries on historical and large-scale datasets.
- **ACID Transactions** – Guarantees atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
- **Optimized Query Execution** – Employs indexing, caching, and efficient JOIN strategies.
- **Secure and Validated Data Handling** – Strengthens reliability in transactional operations.

## Development Approach

The database was engineered through a structured methodology:

1. **Requirements Gathering** – Identification of core entities: users, products, orders, payments, promotions, logistics.
2. **Schema Construction** – Implementation of a normalized schema for scalability and efficiency.
3. **Indexing Techniques** – Index creation on critical attributes to boost performance.
4. **Dataset Creation & Testing** – Realistic data generated for schema validation.
5. **Optimization & Security** – ACID compliance, referential integrity, and indexing strategies applied.

## Schema and Table Design

The system consists of interlinked tables designed for performance and scalability. Key tables include:

- **Users** – Manages customer information such as names, contact details, and addresses.
- **Products** – Stores product descriptions, categories, and brand details.
- **Orders** – Captures transactions, linking users with purchased products.
- **Payments** – Tracks payment modes, statuses, and timestamps.
- **Promotions** – Records discounts, coupon codes, and offers.
- **Logistics** – Handles shipment tracking, delivery updates, and order fulfillment.
- **Reviews & Analytics** – Stores customer feedback, browsing history, and engagement metrics.

## Entity-Relationship Model

The database schema is represented through a **clear ER diagram** that illustrates entity relationships and constraints:
